# PrintA4 - Premium React App

This project uses a portable Node.js installation located in the `nodejs-bin` folder. You do not need to install Node.js globally.

## How to Run

1.  **Double-click `run_dev.bat`** in this folder.
    -   This will automatically set up the environment and start the development server.
    -   The first run might take a few minutes to install dependencies.
    -   Once ready, it will show a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) that you can open in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

-   If nothing happens, try right-clicking `run_dev.bat` and selecting "Run as administrator" (though not strictly required).
-   If you see "Command not found" errors, ensure the `nodejs-bin` folder contains the `node-v24.13.1-win-x64` directory.
